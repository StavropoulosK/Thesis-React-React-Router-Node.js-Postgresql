This application was developed as part of the diploma thesis of ECE student Konstantinos Stavropoulos. It is a scheduling application for winter sports lessons (skiing, snowboarding, and adaptive skiing for people with special needs). The application is publicly accessible at [easysnow.fly.dev](https://easysnow.fly.dev). To run the code, you need to install the node modules (npm install) and have a local PostgreSQL database set up. It is noted that, in order to save resources, the Fly.io server occasionally goes to sleep, so the application may need to be refreshed on first load.
